# auction

I named this project as Auction. I try to done all the steps but couldn't finish step 8 and also face dificulties to show winner. Otherwise everything is nicer.

## dependencies:
I used cloud_firestore,firebase_auth,firebase_core,firebase_storage packages for firebase authentications and store data and image.
I used flutter_signin_button,google_sign_in for sign in with google.
I also used file_picker and intl for picking image files and using DateTime.

## Challanges

Firstly i want to say i face many challanges and also overcome them but i learned a lot. Mejors are:

**In step 2 when i fetching data from firestore i get errors after many try i got the way. Actually i am trying to put data in sub collections so that i couldn't understood how 
to get all the data. Then i use keys for every document to identify.

**Then i face problems for datatypes but searched and solved.

**Another problem was widget overflow. i solved it by fixing height and width. but i hope the UI is worked perfectly for all devices.

**I have faced problem in step 4 and 8 causes i don't get storing data in variables and used it perfectly.

**And finally when i build apk it's give me so much error but some how i managed it.

In this project stackoverflow, medium and flutter documentation helps me a lot.

Thank you
